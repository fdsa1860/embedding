The code used to produce the ICML 2014 submission is included here.

The "Assist_Code" folder contains the data preprocessing script and some basic functions

The ,m file named in the format "test_*.m" are the script to test the un/supervised 
manifold embedding algorithms. A .mat file will be saved after the script are executed.

TEST_MAIN.m file shows that how to run these test scripts.

"NNIntersection.m" and "LLEWReconstrunction.m" are the code to evaluate the data structure 
preservation of the manifold embedding algorithms.
